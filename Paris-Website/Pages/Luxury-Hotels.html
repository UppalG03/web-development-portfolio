    <h2> Top 10 best luxury hotels in France</h2>
    <br>
    <p>According to <a href="https://www.unwto.org/">the
     United Nations World Tourism Organisation</a>, 
     France has been the world’s most popular tourist
     destination for over 25 years. Some people visit 
     France simply because they consider it one of the
     most beautiful countries in the world, with 
     outstanding gastronomy and a sophisticated culture. 
     Others visit France for its famous shops, wide variety 
     of tourist attractions, beautiful beaches, or specific 
     seasonal events such as the Strasbourg Christmas
     market. The magnificent country also has a string of
     ultraluxe hotels that matches its cultural and natural
     heritage. Here’s my selection of the 10 best luxury
     hotels and resorts in La Douce France.

      HOTEL DE LA CITE CARCASSONNE - MGALLERY BY SOFITEL</a></h4>
      <p>The walled city of Carcassonne stands high on a
        hill above the River Aude, overlooking the valley 
        of Laurageais and the lush Minervois vineyards. It is
        Europe’s largest fortified citadel, each stone a mute
       witness to its romantic past. Standing between two
       historic landmarks, the Roman Chateau Comtal and the
       Gothic Basilica of Saint-Nazaire, the Hotel de la Cite
       is set in its own glorious gardens. Each of its 60 
       rooms and suites is individually furnished and 
       decorated in traditional style – matched by modern 
       comfort, and all rooms feature the most up to date 
       facilities including air conditioning, sound-proofing,
       direct dial telephone and television. The decor of the 
       hotel has been created by the celebrated designers 
       Gerard Gallet and Jean-Michel Ley.</p>
