<h2>1. Swerve the Mona Lisa and go on a feminist tour of the Louvre</h2>

<strong>What is it?</strong> It's the Louvre, duh

<p><strong>Why go?</strong> The thing Paris is known for, this spectacular
glass pyramid has been around since 1983, when it was
commissioned by Mitterrand. You could spend hours wandering
around the outside of it with a coffee, but the inside is
a never-ending treasure trove of cultural artefacts, from
the likes of the ancient Greeks to the Egyptians. And yes,
the Mona Lisa is in there too, but there’s also a ‘feminist
tour’ you can take, for something different.</p>
<div><strong>Don't miss: </strong>Make a plan before you
go and stick to it. We can't stress enough how much stuff
is in there.</div>

<h2>2. Eat at insanely stylish neo-bistro Septime</h2>

<strong>What is it? </strong> Michelin-starred chef Bertand
Grebaut's unique restaurant venture in Fauborg Saint-Antoine.
<p><strong>Why go? </strong>Why go? Offering up two
tasting menus (one a little more extravagant than the
other), this is a dining experience for a special
occasion. Interiors feature antique ornaments, huge mirrors
and bare wood, and the food is delicate, fresh, and
expertly balanced. </p>
<div><strong>Don't miss: </strong>It can get booked up a
year in advance. If you can't get a table try

<h2>3. Stock up on souvenirs at concept mall Merci</h2>
<strong>What is it? </strong>The city's best-looking concept store.
<p><strong>Why go? </strong>In a light-filled building at the end of a courtyard on the Rue Beaumarchais, Merci brings together a collection of influential stylists and designers, from Isabel Marant to Stella McCartney. There’s also an array of luxury stationery, homeware and accessories. It’s hard to know where to look. </p>
<div><strong>Don't miss: </strong>Enter via the "literary" cafe for a break, order a fresh OJ and let your eyes wander around the book-lined walls. Why not read one if you have time?</div>
